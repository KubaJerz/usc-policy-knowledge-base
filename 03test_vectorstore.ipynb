To be so classified, at least 50% of its use must be for regularly scheduled course instruction. The University centrally schedules all general-purpose classroom space, although academic units may have priority scheduling rights in selected rooms.\\n\\nStandard Meeting Times: designated day and time combinations to provide classroom instruction, to allow adequate transition time between classes, and to minimize scheduling conflicts for students and classroom availability. The registrar maintains the official list of standard meeting times for the fall and spring and also for the summer.\\n\\nPercent utilization: in a particular class or lab indicates the average percentage of student seats that are occupied when the classrooms or class laboratories are in use.\\n\\nPOLICY STATEMENT\\n\\nIt is expected that each Academic Units will comply with the policy in order to optimize the use of classroom space and student access to classes. Optimal seat utilization ranges from 60 to 80% depending on the type of classroom space.\\n\\nDistribution of course sections at standard meeting times throughout the day for each academic unit should include at least 25% course section scheduling between 8:00 am-8:59 am, after 4:00 pm, and on Fridays. Failure to have this distribution may result in either no available classroom or non-optimal classroom assignments.\\n\\nCourse sections assigned to classrooms that have 60% or less student seat utilization based on historical enrollment or approved projections may be asked to relocate to a smaller classroom by the Registrar.\\n\\nClassrooms are reserved for classes with standard meeting times (unless an exception has been granted) and will be centrally scheduled by the Registrar.\\n\\nRenovations and installations made in general purpose classrooms by academic units are to be cleared by the Provost, the University Registrar, and the Facilities Department. All renovations made to general purpose classrooms during the summer session are to be completed no later than August 15.\\n\\nPROCEDURES\\n\\nThe Office of the Registrar schedules course sections in classrooms. The process takes into account historical enrollment, enrollment projections based on any new information, (such as curriculum changes), requirements associated with size and type of class, priority over particular classroom space by academic units, and proximity of the classroom to the academic unit offering the course.\\n\\nExceptions to standard meeting times can be requested from and granted by the Office of Registrar. Typical exceptions that may be granted are for graduate classes and upper division undergraduate classes in which cohort groups with block scheduling are enrolled. Exceptions are unlikely to be granted for large lecture halls.\\n\\nAfter the first week of classes has been concluded, classrooms that are not used for regularly schedule course sections may be scheduled for other events (see Policy UNIV 6.00 for usage guidelines).\\n\\nRELATED UNIVERSITY, STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES\\n\\nHISTORY OF REVISIONS\\n\\nDATE OF REVISION REASON FOR REVISION November 5, 2003 New policy approval. September 21, 2012 Policy updated to reflect changes in the exam schedule and to set a deadline for classroom renovations made during the summer session. February 27, 2019 Policy updated to reflect standard format and increased need for optimal class scheduling and classroom utilization.

The purpose of this policy is to outline the procedures for an immediate interim removal from campus housing or an immediate interim relocation to a newly assigned space in the residence halls.\\n\\nDEFINITIONS\\n\\nHousing removal/cancellation of housing contract: an action requiring that a student be removed from that student\\'s on-campus room either on a temporary, interim basis or permanently if found responsible for a Code of Conduct violation. Students removed from housing are restricted from university housing operated facilities.\\n\\nHousing relocation: an action requiring that a student be either immediately moved to a newly assigned on-campus housing room on an interim basis during the time a disciplinary complaint is investigated, resolved, or relocated on a permanent basis if the student is found responsible for a Code of Conduct violation.\\n\\nStudent: A person who is currently enrolled at the university, or who is accepted for admission or readmission to the university, or who has been enrolled at the university in a prior semester or summer session and is eligible to continue enrollment in the semester or summer session that immediately follows, or who is attending an educational program sponsored by the university while that person is on campus, or who engaged in prohibited conduct at a time when the individual met the above criteria. Individuals who are not currently enrolled at the university remain subject to the disciplinary process for conduct that occurred while they were enrolled.\\n\\nPOLICY STATEMENT\\n\\nAs a community of scholars, students are encouraged to engage in behaviors that are consistent with the Carolinian Creed. Fraternity and Sorority Life, the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity and University Housing are responsible for promoting positive community standards and responding to violations of policies published in STAF 6.26 Student Code of Conduct along with campus housing policies and regulations for single undergraduate student contracts, as stated in this policy. Campus housing policies and regulations are designed to promote the health, safety, and overall well-being of residents and ensure that the residential living environment is conducive for a resident\\'s academic success.\\n\\nIn situations where alleged student misconduct is reasonably deemed to threaten the health or\\n\\nsafety of a community member or residence hall property, immediate interim action, including relocation or removal from housing may be necessary to ensure a safe environment for all residents. Interim action is limited in time and scope; the interim action is only valid for the short period where the disciplinary allegation is resolved through the university\\'s official process complete with student access to all due process protections provided by university policy.\\n\\nPROCEDURES\\n\\nA.

Reasons for Interim Removal/Relocation\\n\\nImmediate interim removal or immediate interim relocation may be imposed upon a student by University Housing when there is reasonable cause to believe, based on available facts, that the student is a threat to the safety, health or welfare of any member of the residence hall community or residence hall property.\\n\\nImmediate interim action may be warranted by the potential or threatened danger or disruption but is initiated only when the serious nature or immediacy of the threat makes it impractical to postpone action until the resolution of the pending disciplinary case.\\n\\nImmediate interim action may also be initiated during the last three weeks of each semester when a student\\'s behavior interferes with other students\\' efforts to study or sleep.\\n\\nC. Procedure for Interim Removal/Relocation\\n\\nThe decision for an immediate interim removal or immediate interim relocation will be made by the Director of Residence Life or designee.\\n\\nWhen a student is removed or relocated on an immediate interim basis, the student is given notice explaining the reasons for the removal or relocation, an estimate of the duration, any special conditions that apply and a link to the Immediate Interim Removal or Relocation policy.\\n\\nImmediate interim removal from campus housing or immediate interim relocation to another housing assignment is an action requiring that a student immediately leave the residence hall or residential area.\\n\\nWhen a student is notified of their immediate interim removal from campus housing, that student is prohibited from entering any residence hall on campus without written permission from the Office of Student Conduct.\\n\\nA student notified of an immediate interim removal or immediate interim relocation also will be referred for appropriate disciplinary action. The immediate interim removal or immediate interim relocation will remain in effect until all disciplinary charges are resolved.\\n\\nAny refunds for the time period the immediate interim removal or immediate interim relocation is in effect are not automatic, during times of crisis including but not limited to non-compliance Covid 19 addendum and the Terms and Conditions of the Housing Agreement and will be determined on a case by case basis by the Executive Director or designee.\\n\\nRELATED UNIVERSITY, STATE AND FEDERAL POLICIES\\n\\nSTAF 4.03 Campus Housing Policies and Regulations\\n\\nSTAF 4.11 Resident Student Conduct\\n\\nSTAF 6.26 Student Code of Conduct\\n\\nUNIV 3.03 Quarantine and Isolation of Students, Faculty and Staff\\n\\nUNIV 3.04 Communicable Disease Outbreak Mitigation Measures\\n\\nHISTORY OF REVISIONS\\n\\nDATE OF REVISION REASON FOR REVISION May 1, 1995 New policy approval September 3, 2014 Policy organization, content, and accuracy reviewed; no substantive revisions required.
